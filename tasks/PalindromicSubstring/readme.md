## Problem

Given a string str, find the longest palindromic substring in str.

`A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar or the number 10801.`

### Example 1:

```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

### Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```
